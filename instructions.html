<h1>How to Use Neuron Sandbox</h1>

Neuron Sandbox teaches how a single linear threshold unit
&mdash; the basic building block of neural network technology powering
much of modern AI &mdash; computes the answers to decision problems.
It can be used from upper elementary school through undergraduate
computing education.  It comes with a set of pre-defined problems of
increasing difficulty, but it also offers a convenient editing mode
for creation of new problems without any coding.  New problems can be
saved to a file and loaded them from either a file path or a URL.<p/>

<h3> Solve for Weights/Threshold </h3>

"Solve for Weights" is the default mode for Neuron Sandbox.  It
presents a table of example inputs and desired outputs and invites the
user to modify one or more of the neuron's weights and/or its
threshold to achieve the desired behavior.  Any rows (examples) that
are not being processed correctly are flagged in red.<p/>

Problems are presented in order of increasing difficulty.  The
simplest problems have two symmetric positive weights, a non-negative
threshold, and only ask the user to modify a single parameter.<p/>

The "<b>How does this work?</b>" button toggles display of an explicit
equation for the neuron's activation value.  The equation multiplies
each input by its respective weight.  The Greek letter &Sigma; denotes
this activation value.  Rather than specifying a summation, &Sigma;
stands for the result of the summation.<p/>

The <b>Hint</b> button displays a hint about which parameter to
modify.  Pressing it again provides a more explicit hint: whether the
parameter should be increased or decreased.  Hints are computed
automatically based on the current parameter values.<p/>

As students become familiar with linear threshold units they will
discover some helpful rules of thumb, or they can be taught these
rules explicitly.  Here are two of them:

<ul>
  <li> If an all-zero input (first row of the inputs table) is
  required to produce a 1 as output, the unit's threshold value must
  be negative.<p/>

  <li> When comparing two rows of the inputs table, if changing a
    single input from 0 to 1 causes the corresponding desired output
    to change from 1 to 0, that input must have a negative weight.<p/>
</ul>

<h3> Solve for Outputs </h3>

Some students need practice mapping between an English description of
a problem and the corresponding truth table.  This may impede their
ability to solve for weights and threshold because they must rely on
the "Desired Output" display, which may conflict with their mistaken
intuition about what the output should be.<p/>

"Solve for Outputs" mode allows students to practice predicting the
correct output for a given input pattern by having them fill in the
truth table values themselves.  The "Press to Check" button can be
used to verify the correctness of the user's answers.  Optionally, the
problem creator can attach a hint to each row of the table to help
students understand the justification for each answer.  Once the truth
table is filled correctly the user is invited to switch to solving for
the weights and threshold.<p/>

If you want a given problem to start out in "Solve for Outputs" mode
when first loaded, switch to that mode before saving the problem to a
file.<p/>

<h3> Solve for Boundary </h3>

For 2-input problems, "Solve for Boundary" mode displays the decision
boundary as a blue line and the input cases as points in the plane.
The half of the plane where the unit's net activation is positive (so
the output will be 1) is shown in green; the other half is shown in
red.  Sliders provide direct control of the weights and
threshold/bias.  It's also possible to move the decision boundary
directly by clicking on one of the blue square control points (which
will turn yellow) and then clicking again to indicate where the point
should move to.  The middle control point adjusts only the threshold,
while the other two adjust both the weights and threshold.  The "Flip
Sign" button flips the signs of the weights and threshold, which
leaves the boundary unchanged but swaps the red and green regions in
the plot.<p/>

For 1-input problems the two input points are plotted on a number line
and the decision boundary is a blue bisector of that line.<p/>

Support for 3-input problems is in development.<p/>

<h3> Threshold Display vs. Bias Display </h3>

Normally Neuron Sandbox displays a threshold value inside the neuron
body.  The activation value is compared against this threshold.  But
real neural networks don't use adjustable thresholds; they use a bias
connection instead, with the threshold fixed at 0.  If "Show Bias" is
enabled for a problem, there will be a slider allowing the user to
switch the display between "Threshold mode" and "Bias mode".<p/>

In "Bias mode" the effective threshold value &theta; is displayed as
a weight &ndash;&theta; on a bias connection whose input is fixed at
1, and the actual threshold is fixed at 0.  Note that switching modes
only affects the display; it does not affect the operation of the
neuron.  The neuron will produce the same outputs in either mode.  But
the activation values and threshold are different.<p/>

<h3> Non-Binary Inputs </h3>

By default Neuron Sandbox assumes its inputs are binary values, which
allows it to automatically generate a complete truth table with
2<sup>N</sup> rows for N inputs.  However, if "Binary Mode" is turned
off, then the inputs can be any real value, and the numer of rows in
the example table, and their content, must be specified by the problem
designer.<p/>

Note that the neuron is still a linear threshold unit producing binary
outputs.  But using non-binary inputs allows for the solution of
problems such as "The class can go on a trip if the number of
chaperones x<sub>1</sub> is at least as great as the number of chidren
x<sub>2</sub>."<p/>

<h3> Creating New Problems </h3>

To create a new problem, select "Blank Model" from the problem list,
and then from the Menu, enabled "Edit Mode".  You can change the names
of the inputs by editing the text in the input table header.  You can
control which parameters are user-modifiable by clicking on the pencil
or lock icon next to that parameter.  There are a variety of other
settings you can adjust, such as whether to use Threshold Mode or Bias
Mode, binary inputs or real-valued inputs, and whether a victory
fanfare should be played when a problem is solved correctly.<p/>

To provide hints for Solve for Outputs mode, switch to that mode and
edit the contents of the text box associated with each row.  Note that
this are different than the hint produced by the Hint button when
solving for weights and threshold; those hints are computed
automatically.<p/>

Once the problem setup us complete, save the problem to a file on the
local disk.  It can then be loaded from that location at a later time,
or placed on a website and oaded via the URL.<p/>
